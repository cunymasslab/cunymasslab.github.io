	abstract = {This research-to-practice WIP paper describes the development and
		evaluation of a generative Large Language Model (gLLM)-based autograder for
			computer programming assignments. Manual grading is becoming increasingly
			unsustainable due to growing student enrollment and the demand for
			timely, high-quality feedback. To address these challenges, this study
			explores the use of automated grading tools to reduce instructors’
			workload and improve scalability. The proposed autograder takes a
			“reverse-engineering” approach, i.e., it converts student code into
			structured natural language summaries, which are then compared against
			predefined grading rubrics. An evaluation is performed using an external
			dataset (the Menagerie dataset), which contains real student submissions
			graded by four human graders. The objective is to assess the alignment
			between grades assigned by the autograder and those assigned by human
			graders. Findings indicate that the autograder closely matches human
			grading when letter grades are considered, though it performs less
			accurately with fine-grained numerical scores.  While not yet a complete
			substitute for human assessment, the autograder shows strong potential as
			a scalable, efficient tool for supporting grading in programming
			education.},

	abstract = {This research paper describes a study of using real-world vulnerabilities to motivate computer science students to-
			wards learning secure programming. Given the rise in cybersecurity incidents due to programming errors, there is a pressing need
			to improve programmers’ secure programming skills. Despite
			educators’ numerous efforts towards this goal, communicating
			the importance of this training to students remains a challenge.
			Grounding on the theory of intrinsic motivation, we propose
			that exposing students to authentic, relatable vulnerabilities can
			significantly enhance their learning orientation towards secure
			programming. Our approach involves selecting vulnerabilities
			from the National Vulnerability Database that are both relatable
			to students and understandable without extensive external context. These vulnerabilities are transformed into comprehensive
			course modules, each featuring a demonstrative video, source
			code snippets of the vulnerability and its patch, and associated
			developer communications about the vulnerability. We assess
			the impact of one of our course modules on students’ learning
			disposition through a study conducted in two universities in
			an identical setting. The study results indicate that students
			appreciate seeing real-world vulnerabilities in detail, especially
			the video we recorded reproducing the vulnerability, and that
			they gain in self-efficacy after completing the module.},
