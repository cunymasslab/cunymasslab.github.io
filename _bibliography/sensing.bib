    ABSTRACT = {Soils are a complex ecosystem that provides critical services, such as growing food, supplying antibiotics, filtering wastes, and maintaining biodiversity; hence monitoring soil health and domestication is required for sustainable human development. Low-cost and high-resolution soil monitoring systems are challenging to design and build. Compounded by the sheer size of the monitoring area of interest and the variety of biological, chemical, and physical parameters to monitor, naive approaches to adding or scheduling more sensors will suffer from cost and scalability problems. We investigate a multi-robot sensing system integrated with an active learning-based predictive modeling technique. Taking advantage of advances in machine learning, the predictive model allows us to interpolate and predict soil attributes of interest from the data collected by sensors and soil surveys. The system provides high-resolution prediction when the modeling output is calibrated with static land-based sensors. The active learning modeling technique allows our system to be adaptive in data collection strategy for time-varying data fields, utilizing aerial and land robots for new sensor data. We evaluated our approach using numerical experiments with a soil dataset focusing on heavy metal concentration in a flooded area. The experimental results demonstrate that our algorithms can reduce sensor deployment costs via optimized sensing locations and paths while providing high-fidelity data prediction and interpolation. More importantly, the results verify the adapting behavior of the system to the spatial and temporal variations of soil conditions.},
